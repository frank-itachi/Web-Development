## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BootStrap Grid
- BootStrap d-flex utility

### What I learned

This challenge made me dig up about the CSS position and z-index properties. In order to put one element over the other I needed to understand the stacking order and also how the x, y and z axes affects the elements inside the html document.

Something that I didnâ€™t know was that for the z-index property to take effect, the element needs to have a positioning property other than the default. 


```css
.col {
    position: relative;
}
 ...

 .sec-col-1 {
    width: 14%;
    background: linear-gradient(0deg, hsl(240, 73%, 65%) -38%, hsl(273, 75%, 66%) 130%);
    z-index: 1;
}

 ...

 .box-img, .main-img {
    position: absolute
}

.box-img {
    top: 40.5%;
    left: 44.5%;
}

.main-img {
    top: 15%;
    right: 3%;
}

```
