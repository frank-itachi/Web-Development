## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BootStrap Grid
- BootStrap d-flex utility
- BootStrap cards

### What I learned

Something that I really liked and learned was that I was able to implement bootstrap cards components with the help of the documentation. I also learned that implementing the cardâ€™s shadow was straightforward by using a bootstrap class. For the mobile design I used CSS media query.

```html
<div class="card qr-card shadow">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code image">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
./* Mobile Design  */

@media (max-width: 375px){
    .section-content {
        top: 15%;
        padding: 0 7%;
    }
}
```
